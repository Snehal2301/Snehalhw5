## R Markdown
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
choco <- read.csv("https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs/data/choco.csv")
head(choco)
```

```{r}
#Question set I
#What is the overall number of chocolate bars rated? --> there are 1852 chocolate bars rated.
nrow(choco)
```

```{r}
#How does the number of ratings depend on the year? Draw a bar chart of the number of reports.-->as the years increase, the count does too except around 2016 and 2017
ggplot(choco, aes(x = Review.Date)) +
  geom_bar()
```
#Question set II

```{r}
#1. How are ratings distributed? Draw a histogram of ratings and describe it. Donâ€™t forget to mention outliers, if there are any.--> As you can see from the graph below, most are rated between 3 to 4. The data seems to be a little skewed to the left. The outliers are the ones that lie outside most of the other values which I think are 1 and 5.
ggplot(choco, aes(x = Rating)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25, fill = "dodgerblue", color = "black") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Chocolate Ratings") +
  xlab("Rating") +
  ylab("Count")
```

```{r}
#2 Do ratings depend on the cocoa percentage of a chocolate bar?--> The data is too scattered and has no pattern so no, ratings do not depend on the cocoa percentage of a chocolate bar
ggplot(choco, aes(x = Cocoa.Pct, y = Rating)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "dodgerblue") +
  ggtitle("Rating vs. Cocoa Percentage") +
  xlab("Cocoa Percentage") +
  ylab("Rating") 
```

```{r}

#3 How do ratings compare across different company locations? Focus on the three locations with the most ratings: -->according to the graph, all three locations have the same median but Canada has more points in the upper quartile. France and the US both have outliers.
# Filter data to top 3 locations
top3 <- dplyr::filter(choco, Company.Location %in% c("U.S.A.", "France", "Canada"))
# Create a boxplot of Rating by Company.Location
ggplot(top3, aes(x = Company.Location, y = Rating)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "dodgerblue", color = "black") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Chocolate Ratings by Company Location") +
  xlab("Company Location") +
  ylab("Rating")
```


#Snehal's question
```{r}
library(dplyr)

# Calculate the average rating and number of reviews per company
company_summary <- choco %>%
  group_by(Company) %>%
  summarise(Avg_Rating = mean(Rating), Num_Reviews = n())

# Create a scatterplot of Avg_Rating vs. Num_Reviews
ggplot(company_summary, aes(x = Num_Reviews, y = Avg_Rating)) +
  geom_point(color = "dodgerblue") +
  ggtitle("Average Rating vs. Number of Reviews by Company") +
  xlab("Number of Reviews") +
  ylab("Average Rating")

#Tara's question

```{r}
#Aditi's question
#How do review dates compare across USA, France, and Canada? -->as you can see, Canada and the USA have the same median and France has the most review dates than the other two. 
ggplot(top3, aes(x = Company.Location, y = Review.Date)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "dodgerblue", color = "black") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Company Location by Review Date") +
